							each visit a memorable experience for their customers. They are also vegan friendly, which
							could be

							else.
							cocoa forest, unlike its competition, created an environment
							that caters to every individual with everyones favorite coffee beverages and some new, fun,
							creative
							creations that are unique such as the
							Frankenstein and Cookies & Scream blended drinks. With our off-the-wall personality and our
							cater-to-all styled beverage menu, we have created
							a brand for itself that is sure to stand above the competition. Furthermore, as a small
							coffee shop,
							it could be easier to maintain the business. we have a
							high potential to expand to more locations with different radical themes to attract more
							diverse
							types of people with different personalities and interests.
							and young adults are starting to be more concerned about healthier options when it comes to
							choosing
							the right food and drink to consume.</p>
